# Neovim Configuration

> A fast, lightweight-ish Neovim setup that is  
> **messy** and **bloated** (but still fast).

## ✨ Overview

This is my personal Neovim configuration.  

Some important notes before you dive in:

- 🧹 **Messy codebase** — refactors are… ongoing
- 🧪 **Bloated** — many plugins are installed for testing and forgotten
- 🪶 Still **very light in practice**

If you’re looking for a perfectly clean config — this is **not** it.  
If you’re okay with chaos that works — welcome.
